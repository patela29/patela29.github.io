I discovered thmusiciv.com through a friend early on into freshman year of college. At the time it was a small music blog ran by an author who erratically posted new and interesting indie/alternative/rap music they discovered through facebook, bandcamp, and soundcloud. This introduced me to artists like Childish Gambino, Macklemore, and Geographer before they had full albums out. The site has since disappeared and archives of it are nonexistent. This site is an attempt to continue that legacy so that hopefully one person out there can discover their new favorite band as well.
